At first I had no intention of doing this project since I had no information about musics , notes ,etc.<br><br>
But after that hellish final exam I started to asking for help from others and together with them I did it.<br><br>
Unfortunately , I still don't know thing about musics but with their help I went and found some chords and notes,
and made myself some samples and here it is, hope you like it. <br><br>
and at last; I should thank Amir Hossein and Aref for theirs helps. Love you
